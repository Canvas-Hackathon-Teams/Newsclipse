Newsclip.se is a project of the Al Jazeera "Media in Context" Hackathon. Our goal was to make an IDE for news editors and reporters that provides relevant facts as you write your story. [See our demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIpr-A-BbOM).

An actively developed version of the project [lives here](https://github.com/pudo/tmi).
